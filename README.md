# VOTING APP
A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers.

This is based on the original example example-voting-app repository from the [docker-examples](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) GitHib page and modified to work on the Kuberenetes cluster for learning purposes.

The tutorial used can be found on [KodeKloud Platform](https://kodekloud.com/) under the *Kubernetes For Absolute Beginners Course*.
